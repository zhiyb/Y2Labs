Because word processor is processing characters, and things like line & word counting are all integer numbers.
MP3 decode algorithm & audio effects would require floating point calculations.

In game Quake, 3D algorithm (e.g. rotation, transformation, image textures), music & sound, need floating point calculations.
Properties (e.g. HP, player number, weapons), network communication protocol need integer operations.

LOAD (>20%) & JMP (>15%) used most frequently, as these are used for memory accessing and branch instructions.
Hmmer (Biosequence analysis) uses the most kinds of different instructions, including floating point calcuations.
MCF (Vehicle scheduling) has many integer and logic calculation instructions (probably time calucations).
Integer calculations were used mostly in GCC.
libquantum simulates a quantum computer, it uses Load, control, integer, logic operations.

Use map to associate a structure containing {valid, tag, memory space} to every cache offset. First data would be offset, for find cache block.
